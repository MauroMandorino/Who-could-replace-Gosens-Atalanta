In this repository you will find my Football Data Analyst project work.

The main purpose of the project was to identify pontial players that could replace Gosens in Atalanta.

Data were extracted from Wyscout.

Dynamic widgets were created in order to personalize the research. 

More similar players were identified using minkowski distance.

Lykogiannis, Marusic, and Dimarco were identified as the most similar players.
